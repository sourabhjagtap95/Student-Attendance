To use on any page 

1. copy authentication.php to your directory

2. just add a line at the top every page that requires it.
	
	require_once('authentication.php');

3. to start session use (this will start the seesion required for checking if user is logged in or logged out):

	startSession();

	note: it should be started on each page for proper usage of other functions

4. To login use:

	attemptLogin($username, $password);

	pass in the username and password recieved from the user to the function

	the function return false if authentication failed ( invalid password or username )

	it will return true for successfull login


	Practical usage:

		if(attemptLogin($_POST['username'],$_POST['password'])
		{
			//forward to the required page
		} else {
			//forward to required page shoing the error
		}

5. to logout use:

	destroySession();


6. to check if the user is logged in use (incomplete):

	checkLogin();
